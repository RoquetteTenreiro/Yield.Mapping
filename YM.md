This repository addresses the topic of yield mapping. It provides a detailed evaluation of yield mapping components, technology, calculation process errors, and recomendations for further analysis and interpretation of results. 

## 1. Yield mapping components and technology 

Yield maps provide valuable spatial information on how crops perform in response to a certain degree of Environmental (E) and/or Management (M) practices. Within fields, spatial variation of E and M determine what may be sees as a short-term phenotypic response to an environmental (and management) gradient. When analysing historical yield maps of uniformly managed fields, the GxExM interactions can be simplified over direct responses of G to E. Such  interaction is not unidirectional but reciprocal as the effect of E over G will also determine feedback mechanisms affecting the E gradient. Phenotypic responses, which in this particular case are quantified in terms of grain yield, are in fact the result of complex relations among the vector of interactions between P, G and E. Keep in mind that site-specific management depends on such theoreticall considerations as the first step towards precision management and site-adjusted practices is the quantification of crop variations over space and time. Yield maps provide us one of the most pragmatic and technically oriented sort of data to pursuit such strategy.
