This repository addresses the topic of yield mapping. It provides a detailed evaluation of yield mapping components, technology, the main calculation process errors, and recomendations for correction, further analysis and interpretation of results. 

## 1. Yield mapping components and technology 

Yield maps provide valuable spatial information on how crops perform in response to a certain degree of Environmental (E) and/or Management (M) practices. Within fields, and for a particular growing season, the spatial variation of E (e.g. soil texture, soil water holding capacity and depth, pH and soil nutrient availability) and M (e.g. sowing rate and date, fertilization and crop protection) determine what can be understood as a 'short-term' phenotypic response (P) to an environmental (and management, whether variable) gradient. When analysing historical yield maps of uniformly managed fields, the GxExM interactions can be simplified as direct responses of GxE interactions. Such  interactions are not merely unidirectional, but reciprocal. The effect of E over G does also determine feedback mechanisms that affect the observed E gradient over a single field. The spatial variation of crop perfromance (P=GxE), which in this particular case is quantified in terms of grain yield, is in fact the result of multiple relations among the vector of interactions that links P to G and E. Please keep in mind that site-specific management depends on such theoretical considerations, as the first step towards precision management is the quantification of crop variations over space and time. Yield maps provide us one of the most pragmatic and technically oriented sort of data to pursuit such strategy.
